`chaind` is a process that reads information from an Ethereum 2 beacon node and stores it in a database for reporting and analysis.

## Install

### Binaries

Binaries for the latest version of `chaind` can be obtained from [the releases page](https://github.com/wealdtech/chaind/releases/latest  ).

### Docker

You can obtain the latest version of `chaind` using docker with:

```
docker pull wealdtech/chaind
```

### Source

`chaind` is a standard Go binary which can be installed with:

```sh
go get github.com/wealdtech/chaind
```

# Usage
Data gathers four pieces of information from the beacon node, broken down by the modules that obtain the information:

  - **Proposer duties** The proposer duties module provides information on the validator expected to propose a beacon block at a given slot.
  - **Beacon committees** The beacon committees module provides information on the validators expected to attest to a beacon block at a given slot;
  - **Validators** The validators module provides information on the current statue of validators.  It can also obtain information on the validators' balances and effective balances at a given epoch; and
  - **Blocks** The blocks module provides information on blocks proposed for each slot.  This includes:
    - the block structure
    - attestations
    - proposer slashings
    - attester slashings
    - voluntary exits

# Requirements to run `chaind`
## Database
At current the only supported backend is PostgreSQL.  Once you have a  PostgreSQL instance you will need to create a user and database that `chaind` can use, for example run the following commands as the PostgreSQL superuser (`postgres` on most linux installations):

```
# This command creates a user named 'chain' and will prompt for a password.
createuser chain -P
# This command creates a database named 'chain' owned by the 'chain' user.
createdb -E UTF8 --owner=chain chain
# This sets up the database schema
psql -h localhost -U chain chain <schema.sql
```

## Beacon node
`chaind` supports Teku, Prysm and Lighthouse beacon nodes.  The current state of obtaining data from beacon nodes is as follows:

  - Teku: must be run in [archive mode](https://docs.teku.consensys.net/en/latest/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#data-storage-mode) to allow `chaind` to obtain historical data
  - Prysm: beacon committee information is not available.  Run `chaind` with `--beacon-committees.enable=false` to disabled fetching this information
  - Lighthouse: beacon committee information is not available.  Run `chaind` with `--beacon-committees.enable=false` to disabled fetching this information

# Configuring `chaind`
The minimal requirements for `chaind` are references to the database and beacon node, for example:

```
chaind --chaindb.url=postgres://chain:secret@localhost:5432 --eth2client.address=localhost:5051
```

Here, `chaindb.url` is the URL of a local PostgreSQL database with pasword 'secret' and 'eth2client.address' is the address of a supported beacon client node (gRPC for Prysm, HTTP for Teku and Lighthouse).

`chaind` allows additional configuration for itself and its modules.  It takes configuration from the command line, environment variables or a configuration file, but for the purposes of explaining the configuration options the configuration file is used.  This should be in the home directory and called `.chaind.yml`.  Alternatively, the configuration file can be placed in a different directory and referenced by `--base-dir`, for example `--base-dir=/home/user/config/chaind`; in this case the file should be called `chaind.yml` (without the leading period).

```
# log-level is the base log level of the process.
# 'info' should be a suitable log level, unless detailed information is
# required in which case 'debug' or 'trace' can be used.
log-level: info
# log-file specifies that log output should go to a file.  If this is not
# present log output will be to stderr.
log-file: /var/log/chaind.log
chaindb:
  # url is the URL of the PostgreSQL database.
  url: postgres://chain:secret@localhost:5432
# eth2client contains configuration for the Ethereum 2 client.
eth2client:
  # log-level is the log level of the specific module.  If not present the base log
  # level will be used.
  log-level: debug
  # address is the address of the beacon node.
  address: localhost:5051
# blocks contains configuration for obtaining block-related information.
blocks:
  # enable states if this module will be operational.
  enable: true
  # address is a separate connection for this module.  If not present then
  # chaind will use the eth2client connection.
  address: localhost:5051
  # start-slot is the slot from which to start.  chaind should keep track of this itself,
  # however if you wish to start from a later slot this can be set.
  # start-slot: 2000
  # refetch will refetch block data from a beacon node even if it has already has a block
  # in its database.
  # refetch: false
# validators contains configuration for obtaining validator-related information.
validators:
  enable: true
  # balances contains configuration for obtaining validator balances.  This is
  # a separate configuration flag for two reasons.  First, it can take a long
  # time to retrieve this information.  Second, the information can be
  # derived from the data obtained by the other modules.
  balances:
    enable: false
# beacon-committees contains configuration for obtaining beacon committee-related
# information.
beacon-committees:
  enable: true
# proposer-duties contains configuration for obtaining proposer duty-related
# information.
proposer-duties:
  enable: true
```
